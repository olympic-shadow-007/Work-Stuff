This project was born out of necessity. A colleague of mine initially developed a similar tool that was incredibly useful for adjusters. Unfortunately, they decided to take it down.

In response, I created this console to ensure that adjusters have quick, easy access to all the information they need, all in one convenient place. My goal is to provide a reliable tool that enhances your workflow without any unnecessary complications.

Feel free to explore and make the most of it!
