This project was born out of necessity. A colleague of mine initially developed a similar tool that was incredibly useful for adjusters, but unfortunately, they decided to take it down.

In response, I created this console to ensure that adjusters have quick and easy access to all the information they need in one convenient place. My primary goal is to provide a reliable tool that enhances your workflow without any unnecessary complications.

I want to clarify that I have no intention of selling this tool to the company or any other entity, nor do I expect any compensation for its use. However, should the company decide to offer any form of compensation, I am open to accepting it. This project serves primarily as practice and as a demonstration of my abilities.

Furthermore, I am open to incorporating any ideas that would improve the tool. In the event that I am no longer with the company, whether due to termination or voluntary departure, I am willing to create and provide access to an email and GitHub account for the continued maintenance of the website by the company.

This statement should be considered legally binding, outlining my intent to ensure the tool remains available for the benefit of adjusters without any commercial obligations on my part.
